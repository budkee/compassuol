1) Do everything in VBox Instance setup, Standalone install of hadoop and pseudo-distributed install of hadoop 

2) Update the following configuration settings 

a) In etc/hadoop/core-site.xml : update the hdfs hostname to master instead of localhost 
b) In etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml : add a property name = yarn.resourcemanager.hostname ; value = master
c) In etc/hadoop/slaves update localhost to slave

Cleanup : Delete the contents of /tmp/hadoop-master directory

3) Stop your VM. Clone it : give the clone the name slave 
Note: Check the box to Re-initialize all MAC addresses

4) On slave in change the host name from master to slave in 
/etc/hosts 
/etc/hostname 
Add a line to /etc/hosts
192.168.56.101  master 

5) Update the ip address in  /etc/network/interfaces on slave to 192.168.56.102

6) On master update /etc/hosts 
192.168.56.102  master 

7) On master 
$ ssh-copy-id master@slave

8) On master you can now format namenode and start the Hadoop daemons

$ hdfs namenode -format 
$ cd $HADOOP_HOME 
$ sbin/start-dfs.sh
$ sbin/start-yarn.sh
